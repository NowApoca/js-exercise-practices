The idea of this github is to get some discipline in coding exercises.

I will do my best for coding 2 hours everyday solving different exercises.

Exercises will be extracted from EulerProject/Hackerrank/Daily Coding Exercises as sources examples.

I am making it public just for trying to force me to push it everyday!

HOW TO USE IT:

Add a .js file to the folder of the problem or just add a function to one of the .js files of the problem folder solutions. When running the tests, it will run all tests with all exported functions of the problem folder.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Make a PR, I will review it and after squash, merge it
